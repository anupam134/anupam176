Prerequisites
Install Required Libraries

If not already installed, you need to install smtplib and email. These are part of Python's standard library, so no external installation is required.
Enable Less Secure App Access

Gmail has restricted less secure apps. You'll need to enable access for less secure apps or use an App Password if Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is enabled.
To generate an App Password:
Go to your Google Account → Security → App Passwords → Generate and replace your password with the App Password.
Correct SMTP Configuration

Gmail SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com.
Use port 587 for TLS encryption or port 465 for SSL encryption.
Update server.starttls() to smtplib.SMTP_SSL() for port 465.
Secure Sensitive Information

Avoid hardcoding credentials like email and password directly in the script.
Use environment variables or a configuration file.
